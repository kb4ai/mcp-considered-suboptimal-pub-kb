  "key_insight": "Firecrawl's official listing in Anthropic's own Claude Code plugin marketplace uses source type 'url' pointing to a git repository that implements a CLI-based Skill integration. Despite Firecrawl also maintaining a separate MCP server (firecrawl-mcp-server), the marketplace entry deliberately uses the CLI/Skill approach. This is direct evidence from Anthropic's own curated registry that CLI over MCP is the preferred pattern for agent tool integration.",
  "context": "The marketplace.json contains ~50 plugins. Firecrawl is the last entry. The source field specifies 'url' type with a git repo, not an MCP server configuration. The plugin installs a CLI skill, not an MCP server.",
