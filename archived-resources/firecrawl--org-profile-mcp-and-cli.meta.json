  "key_insight": "Firecrawl explicitly maintains BOTH a Model Context Protocol server (firecrawl-mcp-server) AND a CLI-based agent skill (firecrawl-cli / firecrawl-claude-plugin). The org profile lists them as separate products side-by-side. This confirms the choice to use CLI for the official Claude Code marketplace plugin was deliberate, not due to lack of MCP capability. Firecrawl had both options and chose CLI for the Anthropic marketplace.",
