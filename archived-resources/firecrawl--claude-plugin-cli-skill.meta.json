  "key_insight": "The Firecrawl Claude Code plugin is explicitly built as a Skill+CLI integration, NOT an MCP server integration. Installation requires 'npm install -g firecrawl-cli' followed by authentication. The plugin wraps the firecrawl CLI binary as a Claude Code skill. Results are saved to .firecrawl/ directory to preserve context window. This is a deliberate architectural choice: Firecrawl already had a working MCP server but created a separate CLI-based plugin for the official Claude Code marketplace.",
